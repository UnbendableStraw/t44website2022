                  <br><br><h4>In 2014, I started Track 44 as just a teampseak server, named after a song from "Serial Experiments Lain." Over the years, it grew into a small community of nerds just messing around.</h4>
                  <br><br><h4>Late 2021, I picked up an obsession for Apple's "HomePod" smart speaker. For the size (and even price, IMO) it is still one of the best speakers today. I wanted more of them on a budget, so I bought broken ones. Turns out, there was almost no information on how to repair them, letalone how to fix them. After a lot of research, and a little luck, I made breakthroughs in many of their common issues and found a large demand for a service to repair them.</h4>
                  <br><br><h4>Officially launched on 2022 as Nic's Fix, with every repair livestreamed for all to enjoy, with a focus on HomePods, I continue to seek products that no one knows how to repair yet.<h4>
